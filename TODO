### NETWORKING ###

1. Create a test program for UDP connection.
2. Create a test program for TCP connection.
3. Set up the Jetson Orin as Wifi Access Point.
4. Get an ESP-32 and create a test program for UDP connection.
5. Use the ESP-32 and create a test program for TCP connection.

Use the above to send some data back and forth. Inspect data.

### PROGRAM ###

1. Get and deploy WhisperTRT on some data to evaluate its performance. Post results on the project wiki.
2. Get and deploy a language translation model and evaluate its performance. Post reults on the project wiki.
3. Write receiving code for Audio UDP connection.
4. Decide on an architecture for receiving the 2 bit input signal.
5. Publish the finished text on a UNIX-domain socket.
6. Write a separate program that just reads the UNIX-domain socket and starts writing over TCP to the ESP. It must send a text stream and a way to identify which language (user or subject) it is.


7. Using synthetic 48 kHz audio signal, transform it into a signal that is suitable for WhisperTRT.
8. Write test programs that send 1. Synthetic 48 kHz audio signal and 2. Synthetic 2-bit control signal (Language signal and Active signal)
9. Architect a way to use the control signals and settings variables (Language Signal and Active Signal) to control what the entire pipeline does.


### TESTING ###

1. Test the program using various settings variables on synthetic audio signal and control signal (written in above bulletin 8)
2. Test the program using various settings variables on data received from ESP-32 based synthetic audio and control signal generator
3. Ensure we get good program output for both transcribe function (lang 1) transcribe (lang 2) and translate (lang 1) and translate (lang 2), which covers whole breadth of program functionality.
4. Ensure we get good text output on ESP-32 side in serial debug after sending synthetic data from the ESP-32. Ensure the ESP-32 can understand which language is which (and hence, which screen to send the information to).
